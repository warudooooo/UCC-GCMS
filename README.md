# NOTE: This is my university project and I am aware that the code is flawed and not perfect.

### Quick Description:
The UCC-GCMS is a web-based system that stores studentâ€™s violations, problems. This system will also help the University's Guidance Department manage students' problems and records more easily. This system also includes an appointment system that enables efficient scheduling for both Guidance and students.
